### S.T.A.R. Framework
- Situation: For 15.072, Advanced Analytics Edge, the team needed to create a complex and interesting problem related to machine learning to gain exposure to additional, real-world applications of the subject
- Task: Develop time-series forecasting models based on 5 years of ETF data and capture process metrics to evaluate different types of models. Additionally, research was conducted on how to apply ARMA-GARCH and LSTMs to time-series data, going beyond the normal scope of the class for the project
- Action: Using the yfinance (Yahoo Finance) package in Python, gathered the PIMCO Active Bond Exchange-Traded Fund's daily closing prices, representing our models' target. In R, the team developed a framework to apply ARMA-GARCH, considering a variety of model parameters to determine how well they perform and what effects they have on predicted closing prices. We would compare the ARMA-GARCH models with a deep-learning approach for time-series data and a long short-term memory (LSTM).
- Result: Successful development and application of our evaluation framework for financial forecasting models on time-series datasets on over 3,000 combinations of model parameters. Developed a comprehensive presentation and report to communicate key findings and detail the technical decision-making process

### Teammates:
[Tanner Street](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannerstreet/)

### S.T.A.R. Framework
- Situation: For 15.095, Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens, the pair needed to apply in-class knowledge to an interesting and complex problem to gain experience with real-world applications, specifically around the intersection of machine learning and optimization methods
- Task: Improve upon the existing heuristic methods for k-means and k-medoids clustering through the use of mixed-integer optimization, similar to applications shown during the course. Additionally, develop a consistent way to evaluate the ability of these algorithms by comparing various attributes on multiple datasets
- Action: Found 2 datasets through the UC Irvine ML Repository, Abalone and Similarity Prediction, which would be used in the model evaluation and testing. Drafted an appropriate formulation for both optimized k-means and k-medoids clustering. Finally, performed necessary benchmarking and EDA (exploratory data analysis) to determine which parameters we will vary in the evaluation step of the project, in order to compare different methods
- Results: Conducted 216 different tests in order to create final model results for evaluation. Additionally, added benchmarking between warm and cold-start solutions to our optimization models, showing the impact that a combined heuristic and optimization model may have. Finally, due to both clustering methods being NP-hard optimization problems, we gained a better understanding of the computation complexity of these types of problems. Developed presentation and report in order to communicate key findings and detail the technical decision-making process
